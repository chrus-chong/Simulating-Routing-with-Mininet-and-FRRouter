# Simulating-Routing-with-Mininet-and-FRRouter
 In this repository, I explore how to set up a network and use routing protocols to ensure reliable delivery of packets between hosts. More specifically, I will use Mininet and FRR to simulate the distribution of routing information between autonomous systems(AS) through BGP.
